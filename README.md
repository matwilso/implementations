# Implementations

These are generally not best practices or very efficient. They are not for 
practical use, but more geared towards understanding the methods.

## Index:

If it's not indexed, it is probably a pretty rough draft.  If it is indexed,
it may rough, but it is probably decent.

### numpy

#### Reinforcement learning basics 
- [Basic policy gradient method](/numpy/rl/basic_pg/)
	- REINFORCE with 2 layer neural net

#### Robotics/control/probability
- [Gaussian Mixture Model](/numpy/gmm/)

### tensorflow

soon reinforce


### TODO:
- create more official website documentation w/ Github Pages, or just have nice readmes
- create some weight visualizer to somehow display the learned weights and how 
different inputs cause trained neurons to fire
